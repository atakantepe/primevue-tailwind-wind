# PrimeVue Tailwind Wind Preset

![wind-preset](https://github.com/atakantepe/primevue-tailwind-wind/assets/28745098/ff08008e-f25e-498a-9064-f2b99437e61f)

The Wind preset was one of the main presets for the PrimeVue Tailwind project. With the release of the Aura preset, the Wind preset has become a community-maintained preset. 

This preset can be accessed from the [PrimeVue Tailwind Gallery](https://tailwind.primevue.org/gallery/).

## Current Status

From now on, this project will be maintained as a community preset. The first task is to update it for the new PrimeVue Tailwind 0.9.x release changes.

For more context on the changes and updates, you can refer to these issues:

I appreciate all the help in maintaining and improving this community preset.
