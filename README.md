# PrimeVue Tailwind Wind Preset

![wind-preset](https://github.com/atakantepe/primevue-tailwind-wind/assets/28745098/ff08008e-f25e-498a-9064-f2b99437e61f)

The Wind preset was one of the main presets for the PrimeVue Tailwind project. With the release of the Aura preset, the Wind preset has become a community-maintained preset. 

This preset can be accessed from the [PrimeVue Tailwind Gallery](https://tailwind.primevue.org/gallery/).

## Current Status

From now on, this project will be maintained as a community preset. The first task is to update it for the new PrimeVue Tailwind 0.9.x release changes.
